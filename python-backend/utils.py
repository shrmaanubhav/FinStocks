However, to accelerate their early retirement plan, they may need to consider increasing their savings rate, investing in tax-efficient instruments, and optimizing their investment portfolio.

    Retirement Strategy:

    To achieve early retirement at 50, the investor should focus on the following strategies:

    Maximize Savings: Increase their savings rate to at least 30-40% of their total monthly income.
    Invest in Tax-Efficient Instruments: Utilize tax-saving instruments like Public Provident Fund (PPF), National Pension System (NPS), or tax-efficient mutual funds to minimize tax liabilities.
    Optimize Investment Portfolio: Allocate their investments across a mix of low-risk instruments (e.g., fixed deposits, bonds) and moderate-risk instruments (e.g., equity mutual funds, stocks).

    Consider Professional Advice: Consult with a financial advisor to get personalized investment advice and guidance.
