Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) are leading in AI chips. Is it wise to hold both, or consolidate into one for better compounding?
","{'holding': ""Both NVDA and AMD are strong performers in the AI chip space, and holding both could provide a diversified portfolio. However, considering their high growth rates and volatility, it may be wise to consolidate into one stock for better compounding. Based on the analysis, NVDA appears to have a slight edge over AMD, but both stocks have strong potential for growth. It's essential to monitor their performance and adjust the portfolio accordingly.""}",True,False,False,Technology,0,0,0,2025-07-03
